# A list of the local disk directories on cluster nodes that will contain the datanode
# blocks. These paths will be mounted to the datanode as K8s HostPath volumes.

# Custom hadoop config keys passed through env variables to hadoop uhopper images.
# See https://hub.docker.com/r/uhopper/hadoop/ to get more details
# Please note that these are not hadoop env variables, but docker env variables that
# will be transformed into hadoop config keys
# HDFS_CONF_dfs_datanode_data_dir and CORE_CONF_fs_defaultFS need special handling and
# they're already set by the chart so any value coming from below config will be ignored
