# A list of the local disk directories on cluster nodes that will contain the datanode
# blocks. These paths will be mounted to the datanode as K8s HostPath volumes.
# In a command line, the list should be enclosed in '{' and '}'.
# e.g. --set "dataNodeHostPath={/hdfs-data,/hdfs-data1}"
dataNodeHostPath:
  - /hdfs-data

# Name of the k8s config map containing Hadoop config files such as core-site.xml
# and hdfs-site.xml.
hdfsConfigMap: hdfs-config

# Whether or not Kerberos support is enabled.
kerberosEnabled: false

# Effective only if Kerberos is enabled. Name of the k8s config map containing
# the kerberos config file.
kerberosConfigMap: kerberos-config

# Effective only if Kerberos is enabled. Name of the kerberos config file inside
# the config map.
kerberosConfigFileName: krb5.conf

# Effective only if Kerberos is enabled. Name of the k8s secret containing
# the kerberos keytab files of per-host hdfs principals. The secret should
# have multiple data items. Each data item name should be formatted as:
#    `HOST-NAME.keytab`
# where HOST-NAME should match the cluster node
# host name that each per-host HDFS principal is associated with.
kerberosKeytabsSecret: hdfs-kerberos-keytabs
