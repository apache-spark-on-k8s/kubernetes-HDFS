HDFS `datanodes` running inside a kubernetes cluster. See the other chart for
`namenode`.

### Prerequisite

  Requires Kubernetes version 1.5 and beyond, because `namenode` is using
  `StatefulSet`, which is available only in version 1.5 and later.

  Make sure `namenode` is fully launched using the other chart. `Datanodes` rely
  on DNS to resolve the hostname of the namenode when they start up.

### Usage

  1. Find the service IP of your `kube-dns` of your k8s cluster.
     Try the following command and find the IP value in the output.
     It will be supplied below as the `clusterDnsIP` parameter.

  ```
  $ kubectl get svc --all-namespaces | grep kube-dns
  ```

  2. Optionally, find the domain name of your k8s cluster that become part of
     pod and service host names. Default is `cluster.local`. See `values.yaml`
     for additional parameters to change. You can add them below in `--set`,
     as comma-separated entries.

  3. Launch this helm chart, `hdfs-datanode-k8s`, while specifying
     the kube-dns name server IP and other parameters. (You can add multiple
     of them below in --set as comma-separated entries)

  ```
  $ helm install -n my-hdfs-datanode --namespace kube-system  \
      --set clusterDnsIP=YOUR-KUBE-DNS-IP hdfs-datanode-k8s
  ```

  5. Confirm the daemons are launched.

  ```
  $ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep hdfs-datanode-
  kube-system   hdfs-datanode-ajdcz 1/1 Running 0 7m
  kube-system   hdfs-datanode-f1w24 1/1 Running 0 7m
  ```

`Datanode` daemons run on every cluster node. They also mount k8s `hostPath`
local disk volumes.

`Datanodes` are using `hostNetwork` to register to `namenode` using
physical IPs.

Note they run under the `kube-system` namespace.
